# Chameleon
Chameleon is an efficient continuous adaptation framework based on [NVIDIA TAO](https://developer.nvidia.com/zh-cn/tao-toolkit-get-started). To adapt on diverse scenarios, we provide different adaptation strategies and optimization techniques for different visual tasks (object detection, segmentation, tracking and SLAM). In the end, we summary existing common optimization techniques (GPU sharing, ...).
## Scenarios (adaptation strategies and optimization techniques)
### Object Detection
### Image Segmentation
### Visual Tracking
### SLAM (in progress)
## Common optimization techniques
